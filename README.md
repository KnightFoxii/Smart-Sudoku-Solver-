# Smart-Sudoku-Solver-
In the last decade, solving the Sudoku puzzle has become every oneâ€™s passion. The simplicity of the puzzle's structure and the low requirement of mathematical skills caused people to have enormous interest in accepting challenges to solve the puzzle. Therefore, developers have tried to find algorithms in order to generate the variety of puzzles for human players so that they could be even solved by computer programming. In this essay, we have presented an algorithm called pencil-and-paper using human strategies. The purpose is to implement a more efficient algorithm and then compare it with another Sudoku solver named as brute force algorithm. This algorithm is a general algorithm that can be employed in any problems. The results have proved that the pencil-and-paper algorithm solves the puzzle faster and more effective than the brute force algorithm.
